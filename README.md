## Selenium Drivers

Depending on your Operating System and browser of choice, the source of downloads would differ. In this example, we are going to work with Chrome.
Verify the version of Chrome installed by clicking the 3 dots on the top right of the Chrome, then point to About and select About Chrome. Take a note of the version number. You will need to know your version to get the appropriate driver.

Once you download the executable appropriate for your operating system, extract it and place it in a folder. The next step would be to take a note of the folder path. You can add this path to your PATH environment variable or optionally, this folder path can also be provided in the code.
